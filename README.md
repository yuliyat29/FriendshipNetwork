# Friendship Network Analysis

## Description

This R project focuses on analyzing friendship networks using probability and statistics techniques. The project explores various aspects of social network analysis, including centrality measures, community detection, and network visualization.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Import friendship network data from various sources, such as CSV files or APIs.
- **Network Visualization**: Visualize the friendship network using popular R packages like `igraph` or `networkD3`.
- **Centrality Measures**: Calculate centrality measures like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality.
- **Community Detection**: Detect communities or clusters within the friendship network using algorithms like Louvain or Girvan-Newman.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis on the network data to identify patterns or correlations.
- **Data Export**: Export analysis results and visualizations for further exploration or presentation.

## Installation

1. Install R and RStudio (if not already installed).
